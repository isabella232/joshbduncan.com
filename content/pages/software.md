I'm a designer by trade but started to learn development in 2020 and I'm currently developing in Python, [ExtendScript for Adobe](#extendscript), and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I'm sharing some of my projects here in hope that you may find them useful.

## Adobe Scripts (ExtendScript) {: #extendscript }

As a longtime user of Adobe products I often find the need for extended functionality. Here are some of the solutions I have developed.

### Ai Command Palette

Boost your Adobe Illustrator efficiency with quick access to **most menu commands** and **tools**, all of your **actions**, and any **scripts** right from your keyboard.

And, with custom **Workflows**, you can combine multiple commands, actions, and scripts to get things done in your own way. Replace repetitive tasks with workflows and boost your productivity.

### Ai Match Objects

Match one or more objects to another by position, size, rotation, layer, and or alignment.

**My most used script by far!**
