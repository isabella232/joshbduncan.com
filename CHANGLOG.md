## 2022-02-01

- combined build and app repos into one using git worktree ([Git for Static Sites](http://blog.jenkster.com/2016/02/git-for-static-sites.html))

```
# Create the orphan build branch
$ git checkout --orphan build

# Create at least one commit.
...

# Connect local build to the remote version.
$ git push -u origin build

# Head back to master.
$ git checkout master

# Check out the the orphan build branch in its own directory.
$ git worktree add ../build build


# Finally, from now on, to publish both the source and the release it's just.
$ git push
```

- see comment at bottom of page for cloning (Just to be clear: when you clone this repo from Github, you'll have to manually reinstate the directory structure & worktree)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/USER/REPO app
$ cd app
$ git checkout build
$ git checkout main
$ take build
$ git worktree add ../build build
```
